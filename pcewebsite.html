      <h1>PC Engineers</h1>
      <p>
        This is the website of the company I worked for.
      </p>

      <p>One of the first things I asked about when I started working here, was if they had a website and what it looked like.
          Once I found out they in fact did and hasnâ€™t been updated for some time, I started a redesign.
          I first did some research on what competitors are doing; how they present themselves online and how they show their work.
          After this research round, I presented what I found to the owner. We then went about reviewing the existing content and updated the mission statement, created a services list and I created a page dedicated to showcasing previous work.
      </p>
      <p>This took roughly a few months to complete as we worked on this slowly in between projects.</p>
