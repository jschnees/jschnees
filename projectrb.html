      <h1>Project Red Bead</h1>
      <p>
        This was a Capstone Project where I was the Project Manager, Designer and Developer of the company website. My team of 5 created a cruise ship company with a full company page, a user account system and a shopping cart. 
      </p>
      <p>Included in my responsibilities are the marketing materials as well as website design.</p>
      <p>The name "Red Bead" has a story of how it was named which you can read below.</p>
      <p>
          The Red Bead is named after a special bead on sacred bracelet the investor was gifted by monks while studying meditation in the Himalayas.
          The Red Bead was formally founded in the year 1990 with the primary mission to bring people together from all walks of life to help them overcome their barriers and achieve their goals. 
          We bring together the best people with the cutting edge techniques in therapy, health services and life goal achievement.
      <p>
          Our first year was a major failure. We were the right market but at the wrong time. We had meager sales and interest in our services. We didnâ€™t know our market.
          We created some focus groups and consulted leaders in the fields of health & wellness and set our sails in a new direction.
          We bounced back in our next year with our first cruise. While not achieving our sales goals, we did lead a successful and healthy cruise.
      </p>
      <p>
          The following  years we have seen an exponential growth. Each year has been more successful and more rewarding than the last.
          We continue to help people achieve their goals and overcome their obstacles each and every sunrise.

      <h1>Logo Design</h1>
      <p>Below is my current logo study.</p>
      <p>I started with the simple idea of a red cirlce and went with it.</p>
      <p>The problem I currently face is the logo itself doesn't say anything about health and wellness, it only is a literal represenation of the story and name. </p>
      <p>I started experiementing with different designs after the initial circles. However, these are more illustrations then logos.</p>
